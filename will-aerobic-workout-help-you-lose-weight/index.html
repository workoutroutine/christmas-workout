<p>Keep excess pounds at bay Combined with a healthy diet aerobic exercise helps you lose weight and keep it off. Aerobic is defined as relating to involving or requiring free oxygen and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately. This trainers four-week workout plan for weight loss is a winning combo of strength training and cardio to help you reach your goals.
