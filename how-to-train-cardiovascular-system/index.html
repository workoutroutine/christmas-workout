<p>Training the cardiovascular system can be done in an aerobic with the presence of oxygen or anaerobic manner without the presence of oxygen. Subtract your age from 220 to roughly approximate your maximum heart rate during exercise. This article has been written for people who are new to cardiovascular training and who would like to understand more about the best methods and practices available to succeed while avoiding the most common mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="physiological-systems-during-exercise">Physiological Systems During Exercise.</h3><p>Exercising at between 60 and 70 of your estimated maximum heart rate is sufficient to build cardiovascular fitness. The functionally most important adaptation is the improvement in maximal cardiac output which is the result of an enlargement in cardiac dimension improved contractility and an increase in blood volume allowing for greater filling. Cardiovascular exercise aka cardio is defined as an activity that is sustained for prolonged periods of time that improves the function of the heart lungs and circulatory system. The cardiovascular system is the system of vessels that transports blood to and from the tissues in your body making sure that all parts get the nutrients and oxygen that they need. Consult your doctor before starting an exercise regimen.</p>
