<p>Exercise earns you FitPoints about one point for every 10 minutes of moderate exercise. Think of this as your savings account or overdraft protection. As you lose weight your SmartPoints number adjusts so you can continue to drop pounds. If you want to use your FitPoints to be able to eat more aka working out so you can indulge a little you have to meet WWs threshold for swapping your points. And thats the magic number that helps you make food choices throughout the day. Pin On 30 Day.</p>
