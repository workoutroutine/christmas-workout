If you are someone who works out alone or goes to the gym at odd hours Id suggest benching on the Smith machine for the sake of lifting heavy.

<p>For upperbody I did alot of dumbbell work easy to get rid of and alot of leg presses. Unlike free weights where the body adjusts itself by leaning back to accommodate the weights and bring balance working out on the Smith machine prevents you from changing your angle while going up with the weights. In some cases the Smith machine itself has a counterweight that reduces the weight of the bar and often there is. If you are going to use the Smith Machine try front squatting instead of back squatting it works better. If you are benching or squatting it is much easier and safer to switch up grip and stance with a Smith Machine to hit different parts of the muscles you are working.

<p>1 The smith machine does not let the plates rest on the floor so the mechanics of the lift are incorrect the bar is too high to begin the lift. No weight lifted on any machine is the same as using free weights. A Smith machine encourages easy weightlifting due to restricted barbell movement that allows only vertical movements which is unnatural and dangerous. Consequently is it OK to do deadlifts on a Smith machine. As reported in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research bench press strength was about 16 higher for the free-weight bench press as compared to the Smith machine bench press.
