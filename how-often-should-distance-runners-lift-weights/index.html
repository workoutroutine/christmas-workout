<p>How often should I lift weights If you are just starting out you should lift three times a week on your easy running days. Most bodybuilders run to lose body fat. We stop with it only a few weeks before the most important competition.</p>
<h3 id="answer-1-of-4">Answer 1 of 4.</h3><p>But research does not support this type of strength training to improve running performance especially for runners who are already highly trained. If the pressure causes your spine to buckle or move into a more arched position or to move from an even weight distribution throughout your foot then your posture needs work. Beginners should be 85 cardio and 15 strength training. On the contrary an ultramarathoner running 10 hours a week will be able to reduce their strength training percentage while still completing in 23 sessions a week. General strength training has value but specific strength training that enhances the ability of the muscles to perform as they do in running is the most effective.</p>
