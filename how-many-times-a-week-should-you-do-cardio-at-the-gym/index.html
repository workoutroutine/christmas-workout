<p>Answer 1 of 6. If youre a marathon runner then 35 times a week. How many calories will you burn. HIIT High Intensity Interval Training is particularly great for fat loss though you can do what cardio you enjoy the most. If your main goal is strength and muscle mass development a good approach would be 2030 minutes three days per week combined with and performed right after strength sessions so every second day of the six workout days.
