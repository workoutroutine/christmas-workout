<p>First and foremost throughout the last 8 years pretty much all my training has revolved around bodyweight training. Basically you are bench pressing about 50 kilos with every rep you do a push up. Theres a myth that body weight exercise wont build muscle. Also it helps if you have some kind of weights. If you never worked out or arent very active I could see you gaining a bit of muscle without weights but it wont take you very far but if youve got the weights incorperated you should expect gains.
