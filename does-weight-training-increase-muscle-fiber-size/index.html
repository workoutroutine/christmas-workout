<p>I am writing this blog after being asked an interesting question from one of my colleagues Can you increase your type II muscle fibers by following a strength or hypertrophy programme Well the short answer is YES. Muscle size increased significantly in both groups with no significant difference between groups. To produce ever-greater results the weights lifted must become increasingly heavier making it more difficult for muscles to move the load. However assuming your muscle fibers do grow their specific tension will likely remain unchanged though your larger muscle fibers specific tension will still be lower than your smaller muscle fibers.
