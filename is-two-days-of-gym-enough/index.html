<p>You need to be hitting the weights at least three days per week. Your muscles need about 48 hours to rest in order to grow. By all means yes.</p>
<h3 id="so-while-you-might-not-be-hitting-the-same-muscles-as-hard-each-day-you-arent-providing-enough-room-to-rest">So while you might not be hitting the same muscles as hard each day you arent providing enough room to rest.</h3><p>You may be able to see more muscle definition. Depends how your workouts are programmed. If youre only going to the gym 2 days a week try something like a M-F workout or a Tue-Thurs Wed-Sat. Do 2 lighter compound movements for 4-6 sets of 5-8 reps where you could get for sure 1 or maybe 2 reps on each set. Weight training for 20 to 30 minutes 2 to 3 times a week is enough to see results.</p>

<p>You should try to target all your major muscle groups at least twice throughout your weekly workouts. You should take at least one day off after two consecutive days of strength training. Is 2 times a week at the gym enough. Your muscles need about 48 hours to rest in order to grow. Dedicating two or three days to resistance training will tone and strengthen your muscles while burning calories. 2 Day Split Workout Sohee Lee 2 Day Split Workout Full Body Dumbbell Workout Workout Splits.</p>

<p>So more days most likely results in each bodypart getting hit 1-2x per week anyway. Ideally you should do something fitness-related every day since inactivity is a real killer. If youre looking for straight fat loss going to the gym 6 days a week is fine. This will give you the most muscle gains. The volume is relatively low and you will not be suffering much from DOMS as much as a high volume workout routine but your nervous system is going to be taxed hard. 8 Powerful Muscle Building Gym Training Splits Gymguider Com Bodybuilding Training Gym Workout Chart Gym Workouts.</p>
