<p>This is known as an UpperLower Split since you dont just train your chest and shoulders on the same day you train your entire upper body one day your legs the other. Unless youre new to training if you are welcome you understand that when you train larger upper body muscles like the chest shoulders and back the muscles in the upper arm join the party at some point. For the movement you have to pull the bar up to shoulder height with your elbows moving apart and back. This is mainly because its unhealthy for your muscles to be overly stressed. Im personally a huge fan of upper lower full body or pull off push legs off upper lower.

<p>From a muscle standpoint Im not a fan. Back day includes biceps and forearms. Consider training rear delts on back day when you can emphasize them separately from their front and middle brothers. Take a day off and begin the cycle again on Saturday with arms and shoulders. It takes a muscle about seven days to fully recover from a workout notes Karen Sessions NSCA-CPT.

<p>Last week I joined a 24-hour gym and have been enjoying it. It takes a muscle about seven days to fully recover from a workout notes Karen Sessions NSCA-CPT. Take a day off and begin the cycle again on Saturday with arms and shoulders. If you train arms 6 days per week youll do one exercise per muscle group per day with only 2 sets per workout. You can train arms between 2-6 times per week.
