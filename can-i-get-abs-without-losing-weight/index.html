<p><strong>Can I Get Abs Without Losing Weight</strong>, If youre skinny but you want abs is the only way to get abs to lose weight Or can you possibly maintain the same. I dont have calipers or access to a body-fat tank but online measurement tests regularly put me at 11-13 though I think theyre inaccurate since Ive seen 12 guys and I look way less cut Most guides online say to cut 500 calories a day to lose fat for abs but I dont want to drop below 140 because I think Id start feeling insecure if I lost any more weight. Im on the lower side of a healthy weight and id really like for my abs to be visible but im wondering if i can do that without losing fat and just working on building my muscle if that makes any sense.</p>
