Now that you have a full workout program for training legs twice a week I want to give you some more leg workout options.

<p>I train twice a week and do 18-20 sets of the major muscle group and 14-16 of the smaller. Training muscle groups twice per week can match or surpass the results you can get from conventional one-day a week routines. While designing your split is a bit trickier you can see how the twice-a-week approach can work for any other muscle group you want to bring up. But most likely youll have to fiddle with your muscle groups and rest days to ensure you dont mistakenly train a given body part on back-to-back days.

<p>Youre essentially training each major muscle once a week dedicating a full workout to that major muscle with the exception of throwing in some arms at the end of your chest and shoulder workouts. Exercises for your back muscles can either be exercises where you pull a resistance towards your torso through a horizontal plane like a seated row or where you pull a resistance. So this makes it desirable to manage training in a way where you are able to do more than one session for a particular muscle group. You should train every body part twice in a week. Training twice a week is enough to acquire skills and keep them training once a week is not really enough.
