<p>Muscle is a fat-burning furnace and the more you have the faster and easier your body can drop pounds. You only burn calories when you go to work out. Strength training has a more intense effect on EPOC which supposedly balances out the total number of calories burned between cardio and strength training.</p>
<h3 id="but-unlike-strength-training-it-does-not-increase-the-number-of-calories-you-burn-even-at-rest">But unlike strength training it does not increase the number of calories you burn even at rest.</h3><p>Combining both cardio and resistance training is the way to go. Cardio is more effective than weight training at decreasing body fat if you do more than 150 minutes per week. This is because to lose weight you need to spend more calories than you need in your daily intake. Cardio generally has less prolonged aftereffects on muscle gain and metabolism than lifting weights. For the majority of people I would prefer to see them base their training routine around strength training while manipulating calorie intake to achieve fat loss.</p>
