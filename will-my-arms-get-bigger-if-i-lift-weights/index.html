<p>Im 40 been lifting since I was 14When I started I was 59 135 with 11 arms now Im 62 240 with 2125 armsI eat 3 meals a day and train hard as hellBodyfat Is 16 and its fine with me as I dont care to be rippedMy arms wont grow anymore unless I gain weight but I dont want toSo yes train hard and you will get there. But as I increase weight I lift it feels like my arms stay same size. But I see people at Gym with arms thick as my legs even not flexed. Like you did with the squat slow the descent into the bottom position or pause an extra second at the bottom before pushing the weights back up explosively. Would working them out make them bigger or smaller. Pin On Fitness.</p>

<p>Your 1 rep max or 1RM. You cant get bigger muscles without lifting weights and eating protein and green leafy vegetables. Conventional wisdom has us convinced that high reps and light weights builds muscle endurance and makes little contribution to gains in muscle mass. I play tennis and soccer for fun and I love them but my best athletic quality is my speed. Before I get into my take on this issue I should mention that I love heavy lifting.
