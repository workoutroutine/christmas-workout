<p>Hanging Straight Leg Raises. You have been given these exercises to help strengthen the muscles in and around your hip. Do a little weight training at home or the gym and target your quad muscles. In my opinion the only two exercises that are really worth doing in this category are mini-band squats and mini-band bridges or hip thrusts. The core muscles are the muscles in the abdomen hips glutes back and pelvis and the key to strengthening these muscles is making it fun like a game. Pin On Healthy Beautiful.</p>
