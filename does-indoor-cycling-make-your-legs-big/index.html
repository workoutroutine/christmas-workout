<p>Does cycling make your legs bigger. A common question asked by many beginner cyclists fitness enthusiasts and physique-conscious athletes of all ages is will cycling make my legs big and the short answer is it depends It depends on your genetics the amount of calories you take in the type of cycling you do and the gears you ride in. Cycling works your legs and glutes especially when you are climbing but it does not last long enough or provide enough resistance to build big muscles. Indoor cycling or spinning makes your thighs bulky. A bodybuilder or athlete with large thighs may actually find her thighs slim with indoor cycling if the class is used in lieu of max-rep squats.
