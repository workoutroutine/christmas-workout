Because people have to sexualize everything and everybody for whatever reason those concerned will lie about those facts so as not to be stamped and categorized as being less attractive sexually. Meanwhile many thinner folks feel the need to lie about their weight in front of other folks afraid theyll be accused of bragging or much worse having an eating disorder.
