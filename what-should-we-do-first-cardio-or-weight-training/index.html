<h3 id="if-youre-looking-to-build-strength-and-put-on-muscle-mass-research-suggests-you-are-best-to-keep-your-weights-separate-from-your-cardio-work">If youre looking to build strength and put on muscle mass research suggests you are best to keep your weights separate from your cardio work.</h3><p>The majority of fitness experts will advise you to do the cardio after the weight training because if you do cardio first it uses up much of the energy source for your anaerobic work strength training and fatigues the muscles before their most strenuous activity. So that begs the question. If you wish to do both then you really should consider splitting your workouts. If youre focused on lifting a certain amount of weight or mastering a new kettlebell exercise then you should definitely hit the weight room first and supplement it with some steady-state cardio on the treadmill rower or bike. Of course doing cardio first also means you end up with less energy for your workout.</p>
