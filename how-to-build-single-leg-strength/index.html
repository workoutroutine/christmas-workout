<h3 id="building-explosive-strength-in-the-lower-body-can-aid-performance-across-a-huge-number-of-sports">Building explosive strength in the lower body can aid performance across a huge number of sports.</h3><p>1- Squats multiple varieties like pistol one leg squats bulgarian split squat wide squats regular squat with weights 2- deadlifts with straight legs for hamstrings 3- Lounges with weigths 4- run with weights on legs. Reverse lunges will build incredible single-leg strength stability and better glutes and hamstrings. Sure they are great for improving strength but one thing these 2-legged exercises dont do is improve your stability. In the past my recommendation was to always start with the weak side of the body first when performing single leg or single arm exercises then use the same weight if using additional weight and perform the same number of reps on the stronger side. But now I suggest the complete opposite.</p>
