<p>Strength Training on the Bike. If you chop off your legs arms and head what is left is your core. Would it be true to say that if you rode a lot of skinnies that you may see an increase in core muscle strength. If it happens that you are involved in a crash your bones are less likely to crack under the impact. Riders can further increase their core strength and thus their cycling form by complementing their rides with additional core exercises off of the bike says Kruse.
