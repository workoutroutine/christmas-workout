This means if you are doing bench presses for chest as an example you are also training some triceps and front delts.

<p>Performing fewer sets per session at a higher frequency will likely be sufficient for increasing muscle size while also limiting fatigue to allow for higher frequencies and thus more frequent stimulations of muscle protein synthesis. It does this by programming compound movements that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Doing more sets in one session doesnt give better results. The more intense that your training is the more you need to rest your muscles both in between exercises and in terms of days between workouts. This differs from a body part split which focuses on a few muscle groups per training session.

<p>In one workout you target all the major muscle groups including the hips legs back chest shoulders arms and abdominals. Performing fewer sets per session at a higher frequency will likely be sufficient for increasing muscle size while also limiting fatigue to allow for higher frequencies and thus more frequent stimulations of muscle protein synthesis. More genetically gifted bodybuilders may be able to get away with more but this amount works for most. No muscles are ever worked out all on their own. The reason really boils down to time.
