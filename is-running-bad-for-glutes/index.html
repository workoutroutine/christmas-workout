<p>Regular running will definitely get you a toned fit body including a firm butt. The glute muscle must be firing properly in order for our hip to extend forcefully as in the push off phase of running. The gluteus medius muscle is often forgotten in the workout routines of runners and athletes. Glutes get lazy and then other muscles tend to take over like your quads for instance. If your glutes are weak your hip mobility takes a hit so. Pin On Stronger Knees.</p>
