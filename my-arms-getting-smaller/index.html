<p>When you lose weight your body reduces the padding of subcutaneous fat that sits just underneath your skin. Try actually measuring the size of your arms and see if they did get smaller or not. Focus on taking the weaker side to muscular failure and then perform the same number of reps with the stronger side but nothing more. Im using good form why is this happening. Thats because your body pumps out the hormone cortisol which ramps up your appetite and encourages the storage of fat in places like your hips thighs and of course upper arms. Pin On Health.</p>

Arms grow better from more moderate weights taken to failure in the 8-15 range maybe lower on occasion to break through a strength plateau with near perfect form. Hold the weight and let your arms hang by your sides. If you look at a pound of muscle and a pound of fat side by side the fat is going to appear.
