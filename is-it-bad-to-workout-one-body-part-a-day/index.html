Theres also the chance of getting burned out by working out twice a day. Rest periods in between exercises should be limited to 60-90 seconds and rest in between sets should be. Its also a good idea to have a rest day to let your muscles rest. It really doesnt matter how long you workout.</p>

<p>One body part a day training has several potential benefits for muscle building and strengthening. Each day you will work a different body part. Its important that your muscles have adequate rest and recovery time to prevent overtraining. When it comes to two-a-days overtraining and injury are the biggest concerns.
