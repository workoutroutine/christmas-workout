<p>I 26F go to the gym everyday after work. There is another woman 20s30sF whos always there at the same time as me who Ive been somewhat annoyed by since day 1. And the Mirror is great for people who want an at-home gym solution without it looking like they live in a gym. But once you get started youll find they give you an excellent workout even if youre only on it for 30 minutes a day. If there was no womens only gym near me I would workout out at home exclusively.
