Before you know it youll be carrying your heavy baby in one arm and your even heavier diaper bag in the other so its a good idea to tone your biceps now while your belly is still doing the heavy lifting. You want to avoid hearing that heavy exhale when you lift. Bend at the knees not at the waist and lift with your arms and legs rather than with your back.
