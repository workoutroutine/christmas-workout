<p>Doing body weight squats will help tone and build the muscle in your glutes but doing weighted squats will help make your butt bigger. Sit back on the leg press machine and place. Lifting heavy weights will slim the legs because heavy strength training will burn up the fat thats making your thighs thick in the first place. How your legs look as a result of squatting has very much to do with the way you are eating. 5172 Member January 2015. Pin On Tablas De Ejercicios.</p>

<p>Lifting heavy weights will slim the legs because heavy strength training will burn up the fat thats making your thighs thick in the first place. Do squats help get skinny legs. I think I might choose one. Tracy Anderson says cycling makes your thighs bigger. Would i get bigger thighs if i squat and leg curls with weights every time i go the gym i go 3-5 days a week.
