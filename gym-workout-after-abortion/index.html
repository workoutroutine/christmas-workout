<p>Start with light exercise such as walking lifting light weights or yoga. However after an abortion it is suggested not to go back to the exercise routine any time soon especially if the bleeding is still on. You can ovulate as soon as two weeks after an abortion which means yes you could get pregnant again within two weeks after an abortion. You should not exercise immediately after an abortion. No exercise for two weeks. Pin On Body Workout.</p>
