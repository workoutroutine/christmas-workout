<p>You can also go running 3 times a week which will help you burn fat and tone your legs. Maybe in june ill so 2 km and then the start of july ill do 3 the end ill do 4 and august ill do 5 - 6. Okay so this summer I plan on running a couple km each day or most days anyway. Some people will run all their life and their legs will stay slim and toned while others will get bigger legs from running after just a month or so. One of the worries many women have when working out is Will I get bulky like a man Thankfully for most females exercising on a regular basis will not make you bulky.

<p>If I have to pick the most popular question I am asked on my weekly Instagram Q A it would definitely be that. This type of exercise burns fat. Walking is one of the best forms of liss because it helps to get rid of excess fat on your lower half it isnt too difficult to do and its free. But i would not recommend just doing runningcardio and no weight training like squats or lunges. Running is a cardiovascular exercise. Pin On Skinny Challenges.</p>
