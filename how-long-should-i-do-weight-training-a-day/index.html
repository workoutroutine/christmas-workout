Instead I suggest keeping a training log to track the weights you used and increases in strength rather than judging progress by how hard it was to walk up the stairs the next day. Your focus should be great nutrition and 3-5 sessions of strength training per week. Pin On Abs Workout.</p>

<p>Some workouts can be shorter while others can be longer. With that said 30 minutes is an average. Always keep at least one rest day each week. If youre strength training only one day per week aim for a 60- to 90-minute session. How long you lift weights per session will depend on your fitness level goal and how many days youre training per week.
