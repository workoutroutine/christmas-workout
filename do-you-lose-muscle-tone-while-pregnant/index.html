<p>I havent been on this site in a while but read this and had to respond. Advertisement That half-hour or so is long enough to give you cardio and fat-burning benefits but not so long that you overexert yourself. But just like you shouldnt focus on losing fat while pregnant your main goal shouldnt be to put on extra muscle but you can certainly aim to keep your body strong and stable during pregnancy. I absolutely had a tough time with muscle tone. Keeping your legs and lower back muscles in shape can help prevent back pain later in pregnancy. Pin On Weight Loss.</p>
