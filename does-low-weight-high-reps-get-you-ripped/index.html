<p>Hi There My Goal for now is to transform my BF. So what is my specific recommendation for your workouts while cutting. You can also expect to increase muscular endurance with low weight and high rep resistance training.

<p>That will never change. Build More Ripped Muscle. High reps will burn more calories than lower reps.

And doing so in a circuit training fashion with minimum downtime between sets will keep your heart rate highe. Do Muscles Grow At Higher Or Lower Resistant Measures Fitness 19 Gyms.</p>
