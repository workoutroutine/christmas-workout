<p>Should I do cardio during the gaining period. Should I do CARDIO or WEIGHTS. As for the specific amount of reps and sets to perform for each exercise it is common to perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps for one particular exercise and then switch to a different exercise.

<p>If youre new to cardio these moves will help get you up to speed. It is possible to do cardio training and strength training at the same time through circuits intervals and high-intensity weight-training. For example once you can sustain a cardio workout thats at a 3-4 difficulty level you should still be able to talk without too much difficulty for 30 minutes at a time then try adding high-intensity intervals. A short cardio warm up is fine if you find it. This is a question I get time time again from people wanting to lose body fat and change their body shape. Pin On Cardio.</p>
