<p>A moderate to high intensity cardiovascular workout will burn the most calories. But I just find it strange that cardio burns more calories than lifting heavy things. If you are looking for an effective workout that burns calories builds muscles elevates your metabolism and doesnt leave you spending hours in the gym aim for HIIT andor Strength Training. Cardio burns more calories per session but lifting weights will help you to burn more calories in the long run because muscle takes more energy to maintain. Simply put if you are lifting at 70 of your 1RM for sets of 8 reps you will be burning more calories than if you were lifting at 40 of your 1RM max for 8 reps. Pin On Women Weight Training.</p>

<p>Simply put if you are lifting at 70 of your 1RM for sets of 8 reps you will be burning more calories than if you were lifting at 40 of your 1RM max for 8 reps. 2 Although weightlifting has unique benefits due to its positive effects on muscle mass and increasing your resting metabolic rate. Why would that burn calories. Though many boot camp or HIIT-style workout classes incorporate weights your body reacts to them differently than a straight-up weightlifting workout. Simply put if you are lifting at 70 of your 1RM for sets of 8 reps you will be burning more calories than if you were lifting at 40 of your 1RM max for 8 reps.
