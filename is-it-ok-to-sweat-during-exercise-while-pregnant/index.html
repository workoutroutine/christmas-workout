<p>If you exercise in an air-conditioned room or outside when its a cooler time of year you will not sweat as much because the cold air evaporates your sweat faster and also sets your body up to use more of the radiation method meaning your body can deal with the heat created by exercise more easily. Remember it is recommended to exercise while being pregnant but just be safe during your exercise routine. In fact many exercises that are off-limits during pregnancy like mountain biking or downhill skiing are ones youd probably have a hard time doing with a basketball-sized tummy. Although exercise during pregnancy is generally good for both mother and baby your doctor might advise you not to exercise if you have. Ab exercises are also fine during the first 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. Pin On Dr Garima Tyagi.</p>
